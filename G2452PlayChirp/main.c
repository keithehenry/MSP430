/*
The above audio is that of an 8kHz sample of a "chirp" sound, from the chirp_8kHz.wav file.

An 8-bit DAC (8-bit samples, using PWM, and a timer count of 256 per sample), requires a 
minimum timer clock rate of:
 f = 8kHz * 256 = 2MHz

However, this indirectly generates an 8kHz artifact in the PWM audio result. An
audio filter set to play speech, up to 4kHz, doesn't reduce the 8kHz artifact enough.

To overcome this, this code uses a timer clock of 8Mhz, and interpolates between every fourth
sample. The interpolation basically reduces the wavefile storage requirement by a factor of 4.

This version of the code doesn't use interrupts, for debuging the interpolation.
